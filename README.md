# Habit Tracker

A simple and intuitive habit tracking web application that helps you build better habits by visualizing your daily progress.

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project is inspired by **Atomic Habits** by James Clear. As mentioned in the book, "people love to see progress" - and that's exactly what this habit tracker provides. By making your habits visible and tracking your consistency, you create a powerful feedback loop that motivates you to maintain your streaks and build lasting positive changes.
